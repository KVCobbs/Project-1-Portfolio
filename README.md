Issues:

The biggest issue I had was my hamburger menu. I originally wanted to make it without Javascript at all. But I couldn't get it to work. 

My adding my contact page from google forms into my form. 

Resolutions: I found an article explaining hamburger menu with how to make it work using javascript. 
 
I solved my issue about my contact page but using control f to find the entry. info I needed on the page below instead of using the method shown to me using the video jendri linked.
